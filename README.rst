Stack:

- Calibre
- Apache as proxy server


First configuration
===================

Mattermost requires a dedicated virtualhost and it's accessibile only from HTTPS.

To start Mattermost, execute:

:: 

  config setprop mattermost VirtualHost mattermost.yourdomain.com status enabled
  signal-event nethserver-mattermost-update

Then, access ``https://mattermost.yourdomain.com`` and perform the first configuration.


Database
========

Properties:

- ``TCPPort``: Mattermost listen port, change only for development purpose
- ``VirtualHost``: dedicated FQDN for virtual host
- ``status``: can be ``enabled`` or ``disabled``, default to ``disabled``
- ``access``: firewall access, leave blank or at least set to ``none``

Example: ::

 mattermost=service
    TCPPort=5432
    VirtualHost=mattermost.local.neth.eu
    access=
    status=enabled

Account synchronization
=======================

The ``mattermost-bulk-user-create`` command will:

- create a default team named as the ``Company`` from ``OrganizationContact``
- read all users from local or remote Account Providers and create them inside Mattermost

Please note that:

- users disabled in the Server Manager or already existing in Mattermost will be skipped
- a random password will be generated for each user

Forcing a common default password
---------------------------------

It's possible to set a default password for each new Mattermost user, just append the default
password to command invocation.

Example: ::

  mattermost-bulk-user-create Password,1234
